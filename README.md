## Large Language Models as Corporate Lobbyists

Paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4316615

**Abstract:** 
> We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a large language model conducting corporate lobbying related activities.  We use an autoregressive large language model (OpenAIâ€™s `text-davinci-003`) to determine if proposed U.S. Congressional bills are relevant to specific public companies and provide explanations and confidence levels. For the bills the model deems as relevant, the model drafts a letter to the sponsor of the bill in an attempt to persuade the congressperson to make changes to the proposed legislation. We use hundreds of ground-truth labels of the relevance of a bill to a company to benchmark the performance of the model, which outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common outcome of irrelevance. However, we test the ability to determine the relevance of a bill with the previous OpenAI GPT-3 model (`text-davinci-002`), which was state-of-the-art on many language tasks until `text-davinci-003` was released on November 28, 2022. The performance of `text-davinci-002` is worse than simply always predicting that a bill is irrelevant to a company. These results suggest that, as large language models continue to improve core natural language understanding capabilities, performance on corporate lobbying related tasks will continue to improve. We then discuss why this could be problematic for societal-AI alignment.
