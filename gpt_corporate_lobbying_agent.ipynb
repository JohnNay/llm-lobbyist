We believe that this will help to ensure that the prices of these drugs are fair and reasonable.\n",

      "We are also supportive of the provisions in the bill that would allow for competitive licensing of drugs if the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug. This will help to ensure that the prices of these drugs are kept in check and that Medicare beneficiaries have access to the medications they need.\n",

      "At Alkermes, we develop and commercialize products designed to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from addiction and schizophrenia. We have two key marketed products, ARISTADA and VIVITROL, which are used to treat these conditions. We believe that the provisions in the bill will help to ensure that our products are available to Medicare beneficiaries at a price they can afford.\n",

      "We would like to suggest that the bill be amended to include provisions that would provide additional incentives for pharmaceutical companies to negotiate with the CMS.
